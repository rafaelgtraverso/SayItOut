# Say It Out

We all heard about autism and how difficult could be for people who suffer it to talk and express what they want to the people who surround them. Say It Out aims to help them to communicate those things by using the same PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) and adding them audio, so even when they want to say something and nobody is looking they can do it.

This MVP ( Minimum Viable Product ) allows select between 500 cards, create and save phrases. And the most important, will convert the name of the card or the entire phrase into audio.
