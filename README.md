# Say It Out

We all heard about autists and how difficult could be for them to talk and express what they want to the people who sorround them. Say It Out aims to help them to communicate those things by using the same PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) and adding them audio, so even when they want to say something and nobody is looking thay can do it.

This MVP ( Minimum Viable Product ) allows select between 3 thousand cards, create and save phrases. And the most important, will convert the name of the card or the entire phrase into audio.

## Contributing 
There is a lot of things to do yet, after all is just an MVP. We will put here the Product Baclkog, in the meantime feel free to test the app.
Also, if you think don't know how to contribute but want to please contact us, this is a Project, not only an app, we believe anyone can contribute, not only developers.

##### Product Backlog:

Review the cards name and make a change the name of the card.

This are some of the item in our Backlog at the moment, if you think that we could add something to it just let us know.
